# Processor-Design-on-an-FPGA
Team implemented a processor on Nexys4 and Basys3 FPGAs using Xilinx ISE and Vivado. Wrote VHDL algorithms for R-type, J-type, and I-type and defined the testbench to run more than 1000 inputs. The final design implements multiple programs, of which the RC5 encryption, decryption, and key expansion algorithm was presented.
